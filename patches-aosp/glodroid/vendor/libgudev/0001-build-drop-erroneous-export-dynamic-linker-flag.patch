Subject: [PATCH] build: drop erroneous -export-dynamic linker flag

This appears to be a copy/paste from the autotools migration to meson.
In autotools this was passed to libtool where it is a valid flag, here
it was passed to the linker as --entry=xport-dynamic.

It hasn't done anything since 2018, let's drop it.
